# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor code developed from Module 2 in order
for the VBA script to run faster in case larger data sets are used in the future.
The VBA script enables analysis of the datset to determine the total daily volume
and rate or returns for green stocks for a given year.

## Results
As depicted in the screenshots located in Resources, the stocks in the dataset performed differently
in 2017 compared to 2018, with 2017 providing more positive rates of returns than 2018.

## Summary
Advantages of refactoring code are:
- code has reduced complexity, lending to improved readability,
- improved maintainability,
- quicker speeds,
- and simplier, cleaner design.
One major disadvantage of refactoring is that it can be time consuming. Additionally,
you may have to retest functionality of the code.
